#  **Visualization of Motor Accidents in the City of New York**
I made this Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python which is hosted on my heroku server : https://new-york-crime-stats-app.herokuapp.com/
<br />
It analyzes data from provided dataset and projects the findings for filtering important aspects as well as provides a 2D and 3D projection on the map of the New York City.
